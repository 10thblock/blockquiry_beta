## 1. Key Terminology

**Blockchain** is a system of recording information that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

**Decentralization** is, in many ways, the central and defining characteristic of blockchain technology. Applying decentralized processes and tech can reduce or even eliminate the role of intermediaries across industries. For example, by removing banking institutions from financial instruments, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms can distribute profits and governance to users and the wider community. On an even more foundational level, a decentralized network crowdsources consensus, making it much harder for any entity to control or censor the data transacting through the network. However, many experts believe achieving optimal decentralization can decrease network throughput.

**Immutability** in a blockchain context refers to something that cannot change. This characteristic allows data to be irreversibly codified into the shared ledger of a blockchain network after transaction execution. Most non-blockchain computer networks are mutable, meaning that the information inside them can be modified, censored, or changed. Immutability allows a blockchain network user to send and receive crypto transactions that can't be reversed. It also can ensure data integrity for a decentralized application (dApp), blockchain cloud storage platform, and various other blockchain network applications.

**Cryptoassets** are assets built on permissionless blockchains, meaning they have no "permissioned" issuer. These assets include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), governance tokens, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

**Digital assets** are a broader category that includes cryptoassets and permissioned blockchain assets; which have tokenized securities, a more nascent application of blockchain technology, and central bank digital currencies, which are being developed in response to cryptoassets but may or may not operate on a blockchain, depending on design choices in central banks.

**Stablecoin** is a digital currency created to hold a stable value. The value of most existing stablecoins is tied directly to a predetermined fiat currency or tangible commodity, like USDC, which is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. However, stablecoins can also achieve price stability through collateralization against other cryptocurrencies or algorithmic token supply management. Since stablecoins do not fluctuate significantly in price, they are designed to be used rather than as an investment.

**Non-fungible token** (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token representing a unique digital asset that cannot be exchanged for another kind of digital asset. This characteristic contrasts with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and litecoin (LTC), which are fungible in nature. NFTs are created via smart contract technology and are classified with token standards that vary based on the blockchain protocol they utilize.

**Rug pull** involves a developer attracting investors to a new cryptocurrency project, then pulling out before the project is built, leaving investors with worthless currency.

**Airdrop** is a token distribution method in which assets are directly transmitted to user wallets for free. Airdrop recipients do not pay for tokens received. Typically used as a marketing tactic to create awareness around a project, airdrops can also result after a chain fork, token upgrade, or as part of a fundraising mechanism.

**Ransomware** is a type of malware or malicious software that blocks access to a user's computer system or threatens to leak sensitive or personal data. Most ransomware attacks aim to extort a ransom payment to restore access to sensitive encrypted data. Ransomware has become a powerful tool for bad actors targeting users that could potentially lose their all-important data. Ransomware attacks can pose a heightened threat to cryptocurrency users because demands are often sought in bitcoin (BTC) or other digital currencies to avoid unwanted detection.

A **seed phrase**, also referred to as a "recovery phrase' is a 12, 18, or 24-word code used as a backup access mechanism when a user loses access to a cryptocurrency wallet or associated private key. The seed phrase matches information stored inside the corresponding wallet that can unlock the private key needed to regain access.

## 2. Summary
### 2.1 Intro
Blockchain technology is one of our century's most exciting and emerging megatrends. Allowing trustless, immutable decentralized transactions has set up a foundation for new-generation applications that will revolutionize how we communicate online and what society can achieve with greater inclusion across all boundaries!  Trustless, immutable decentralized transactions mean that people will rely less on centralized authorities for communication, payment processing, and commerce; instead, they will deal directly with their peers. This change has and will continue to increase the speed of human interaction, information exchange, and economic activity.

### 2.2 Problem Statement
The increase in the use and adoption of cryptocurrency has brought on an increase in cryptocurrency-based crime. According to The 2022 Crypto Crime Report by Chainalysis, the cryptocurrency-based offense hit an all-time high in 2021, generating over $14 billion for the year, up from $7.8 billion in 2020.

Grauer, K., Kueshner, W., & Henry, H. (2022, February). Crypto Crime Report 2022. New York; Chainalysis, Inc.

Stolen funds contributed more than $3 billion to the overall crime statistics, a 1,330% increase from the previous yearâ€”screenshot of stolen funds.

Our current legal framework is underresourced and undereducated to deal with this new emerging crime trend effectively. Additional challenges include:

- Jurisdiction & Extradition challenges make cyber crime cases hard to prosecute. As a result, district attorneys and law enforcement agencies focus on cases that are easier to prosecute and win.
- Most individual and business cyber crimes are not reported due to the social stigma associated with this type of crime. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has recently suggested that one in seven cyber crimes are reported, which means over 85% of cybercrime is left hidden in an organization.
- The public's limited understanding of the type of crime they may have experienced and how or where to report cybercrime cases makes it nearly impossible to have any confidence in current cybercrime statistics.

**__When it comes to cryptocurrency-related crimes, hearing about them in the news or reading about them in a blog is far behind the actual criminal activity and out of many meaningful mitigating options.__**


### 2.3 Mission & Approach
Safe participation in the blockchain economy depends on governments' cooperation with the private sector and the collective effort of good citizens of the world.

__*Our mission is to be the first place people search for the most current blockchain data and peer-to-peer conversations on and about blockchain activities.*__

We intend to participate in this global effort by building a platform focused on *indexing peer-to-peer conversations* based on specific keywords, *simple and familiar presentation* of complex blockchain data, and a *simplified process of reporting crypto crime cases* to the relevant authorities.

2. Support for additional blockchains and layer two protocols. Most immediate: Solana and Cardano.
3. An image section focused on images of phishing and scam websites compared to actual ones.
4. Crypto regulation section focused on news, regulatory updates, and case outcomes related to blockchain and cyber-related activity.
5. Evaluate the approach to expand the integration of a custom meta search engine dubbed web.blockquiry and tor.blockquiry focused on obtaining information from .onion addresses.
6. Expand the use of our **keyword drilling** feature using machine learning.
